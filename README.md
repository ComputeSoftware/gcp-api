# gcp-api

gcp-api is a Clojure library which provides programmatic access to GCP services from your Clojure program.

## Rationale

See aws-api's rationale [here](https://github.com/cognitect-labs/aws-api#rationale).

## Approach

Much the same as aws-api's [approach](https://github.com/cognitect-labs/aws-api#approach), this library publishes
descriptor files that specify the operations, inputs, and outputs. These descriptor files are created from
the [GCP discovery documents](https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/reference).

The generated descriptor files are published in a separate repository
located [here](https://github.com/ComputeSoftware/gcp-api-descriptors).

## Usage

Using gcp-api requires you to add `gcp-api/gcp-api` and the service(s) of your choosing. In the below example we add
the [GCP Compute Engine API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/) `gcp-api/compute`. Note that you
must replace part of the `:deps/root` path with the API version you want to use.

To use, for example, the [compute v1 api](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1), add the following to
`deps.edn`

```clojure
gcp-api/gcp-api {:git/url "https://github.com/ComputeSoftware/gcp-api.git"
                 ;; update this sha to the most recent
                 :sha     "d52e1646077a49fd0f5fadede7cc6e971a79127a"}
gcp-api/compute {:git/url   "https://github.com/ComputeSoftware/gcp-api-descriptors.git"
                 ;; update this sha to the most recent
                 :sha       "7b00d7c1ff31b03e9cd7df4189ae8dd8e533eec4"
                 ;; you can find other roots by browsing at directories in
                 ;; https://github.com/ComputeSoftware/gcp-api-descriptors
                 :deps/root "compute/v1"}
```

```clojure
(require '[compute.gcp.api :as gcp-api])
;; Create a client:
(def compute-v1
  (gcp-api/client {:api     :compute
                   :version "v1"}))
;; Ask what ops your client can perform
;; It will return a descriptive map describing the supported parameters, response shape, and other info
